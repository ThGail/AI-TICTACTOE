# AI-TicTacToe
Python program generating an AI that can play intelligently to the TicTacToe game.


Welcome to my TicTacToe AI !

This AI is using reinforcement. The AI plays thousands games in random-moves mode and saves all of them to then associate reward. The reward is proportional to the importance of the move.
A few explanations and comments are in the program, follow the #.

I will upload a NoteBook with the program that find the best learning rate.

Feel free to use it. Tell me in what crazy project you would use it or the any update you would propose ! Bye !
