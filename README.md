# AI-TicTacToe
Python program providing an AI that can play to the TicTacToe game.


Welcome to my TicTacToe AI !

This AI is using reinforcement learning. The AI plays thousands of games in random-moves mode and saves them in order to associate a reward to each of them. The reward is proportional to the importance of the move and to a learning rate. A few explanations and comments are in the program **AI_Tictactoe.py**, follow the #.

Moreover, the file **Learning_Rate.ipynb** contains the code to determine the best learning rate.


Feel free to use it. Tell me in what crazy project you would use it or the any update you would propose ! Bye !

P.S : Special thanks to **@alexandrefresnais** who helped in the understanding of the subject.
